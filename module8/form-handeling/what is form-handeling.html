In react js we get data from forms there we used form Handeling 
 There are two way to handel any Form

   a) controlled components
     
       FormData.jsx

       =>when we used useState to manage state rely inside of any formdata i.e called controlled components

        const[data,setData]=useState({
        
             name="",
             email=""

        
        })

   
   b) uncontrolled components

   
       FormData.jsx

       =>when we used useRef to manage   any form input data i.e called uncontrolled components

       import React,{useRef} from 'react'

       const name=useRef("");
       const email=useRef("");
