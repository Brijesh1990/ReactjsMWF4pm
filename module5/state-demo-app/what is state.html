<!-- 
    what is state ?
      state is react object
      state is mutable 
      state stored memory of any object
      state is mutable meanse we change | modify | edit the values of state object on run time
      we used state to stored informations of object in form of string , object , integer etc 
      state is used destructuring of data in objects 
      examples :
      const[currentstatevariables, function]=useState("");
      state is used or intialized inside of react only in function when we used hook.
