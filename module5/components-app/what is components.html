    components are two types 
    
      a) class based components 

            <!-- class A extends React.Component 
            {
                construct(name)
                {
                    this.name=name;
                }

            }
            var obj=new A("Brijesh");
            console.log(obj) -->



            class A extends React.Component 
            {
               
                render()
                {

                    return "<h1>This is brijesh</h1>";


                }

            }
            

      b) function based components

          function default App()
          {
            return (

            <>
            
            <h1>Hi my name is Brijesh</h1>
            
            </>
            )
          }

                 React js 16.0.2 is support function based components while we used hooks.
